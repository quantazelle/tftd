Evidence of presentations of Trump's frontotemporal dementia, with parasupranuclear palsy (PSP) likely

FIRST TWEET:
Here's a roundup of the presentations we will likely see at the SOTU tonight (Feb 4, 2020). I'll break up the tweets based around specificities and provide evidence from the past that shows what to look for. It will roughly be in order of most likely to appear (the first reply after this) to lesser. There are a lot of factors that go into this depending on how it is staged and filmed, and how drugs will be able to mitigate his symptoms today. #frontotemporaldementia #presidementia
